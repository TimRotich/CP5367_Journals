**Learning Activities & Resources**
This week, I learnt more about Version Control using git, how to create a repo, set it private or public, and make a Personal Access Token to allow read and write to the repo. Also, I was able to add my team members as Collaborators  to our team project.
I performed the First commit to our repo and added documents workflow for our team project.

We also connected to each team member via LinkedIn. 

Also this week we connected and communicated through Slack and Miro board on the progress of our team project.

**Estimated Hours**
I spent at least 8 hours this week learning more about GitHub, slack and Miro.

**Content Insights** 
I have learned about version control, and how to perform git commands on and communicate through Slack and Miro.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
I have found that working with Slack makes communication very easy and each team member can follow and track what is going on. Using GitHub help us ad developers to perform version control.
In this case, we work as a team and push all our updated work to Git Hub before merging the changes to the main branch. therefore it is easy to track the changes and to know who did what.
