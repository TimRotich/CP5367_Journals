I learned how to install Joomla 5, manage the administration of a Joomla 5 site, create content, customize the site design, and extend Joomla 5 with additional functionality.

**Estimated Hours**
I spent at least 8 hours of my own time this week thoroughly practising and learning Joomla 5.

**Content Insights**
I learned that Joomla 5 is a powerful and flexible content management system that makes it easy to build and manage websites and web applications. 
Joomla 5 provides a wide range of features and tools for creating, organizing, and publishing content, as well as for customizing the look and feel of a website.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
I found that working through the official Joomla 5 documentation and tutorials was very helpful for learning the platform. The text-based tutorials allowed me to follow along and 
practice the concepts as I learned, which was more effective than just watching videos. I was able to
gain a solid understanding of Joomla 5 and feel confident in my ability to use it to build and manage professional-looking websites.
