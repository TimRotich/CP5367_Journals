Learning Activities & Resources
In this week, I watched linked-in videos and interacted other web development tutorials as shown below and after that I put into practise what I learnt:
1.	HTML Tutorial (w3schools.com)
2.	CSS Tutorial (w3schools.com)
3.	Introduction to Web Design and Development Online Class | LinkedIn Learning, formerly Lynda.com
4.	HTML Tutorial (tutorialspoint.com)
5.	CSS Tutorial (tutorialspoint.com)
I learnt how to link CSS with html files and style the contents of the html page using CSS.

Estimated Hours
I spent at least 4 hours of my own time this week on this subject thoroughly doing practices and getting to learn. 


Content Insights
I learnt that HTML is a standard Markup language used for web pages and it is used to create content and structure the web page. CSS is a style sheet language used for styling contents of the HTML page. It plays a crucial 
role in modern web development by providing the tools necessary to create visually appealing, accessible, and responsive websites.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I found, going through a text-based tutorial is much better compared to watching a video. In this case, the text-based tutorial gives you the opportunity to practise as you continue to learn. For the videos you must
pause first then try to write the code which is a bit tiresome. I was able to learn and implement styles and display content in html files to be more appealing and professional.
