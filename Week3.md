I also learned how to install and use WordPress plugins during this practical. In my practical, I used WP forms to create contact, sign in and sign up forms.

**Estimated Hours **
I spent at least 16 hours of my own time this week thoroughly practising and learning WordPress.

**Content Insights and Interviews**
WordPress is a powerful CMS to build and manage websites. In my case, As Compared to Joomla. WordPress is simpler to use
and more user-friendly. it provides a wide range of features and tools that make it easy to create, design and publish
websites. 
During my study this week, I interacted with my teammates and classmates and got to learn from each other about how they
are feeling so far about the hands-on experience in creating websites using CMS. I got positive responses from most of my 
teammates and they also highlighted their strengths and weaknesses which will be more important while we work as a team. 
CMS make work easier while creating websites and thus cuts the cost and time for developing websites. 

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights **
I found that working through the official WordPress documentation and tutorials was very helpful for learning WordPress. 
The text-based tutorials allowed me to follow along and practice the concepts as I learned, which was more
effective than just watching videos. I was able to gain a solid understanding of 
WordPress and feel confident in my ability to use it to build and manage professional-looking websites.
