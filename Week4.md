**Learning Activities & Resources **
This week, I learned and practised how to host WordPress both on localhost and online servers with a database.
I used tutorials to learn how to perform all this and these are the important links that I used: 


https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html - link to download Xampp. 

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/install-wordpress-on-localhost-with-xampp-server - tutorial to install WordPress on localhost with xampp server.


**Estimated Hours **
I spent at least 20 hours of my own time this week thoroughly practising and setting up WordPress with a database both online and locally.

**Content Insights**
WordPress is a more user-friendly CMS and easy to use. WordPress comes with a pre-built database containing some tables and some dummy data.
The best practice is connecting WordPress with a local or online server. For local purposes, I used  Xampp which is a powerful localhost server that
also comes in with the MYSQL database. After installing Xampp, I added the following connection info to WordPress during installation:
1. Host - localhost
2. port - 443
3. username - root
4. password ""
   
If all these details are correct and the local server is running efficiently, then WordPress can install successfully with the database already set up.
After that, I used phpMyAdmin to visualize my database. phpMyAdmin works the same as a Mysql WorkBench and I have attached screenshots of this.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights **
I have learned how to work with WordPress both locally and online. I learnt how to push my updates from the local server to the live server. in this case,
I learnt how to also update live database by pushing changes made to the remote/local database. I can say am getting better at learning how to work with WordPress.
